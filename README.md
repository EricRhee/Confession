// Description: Confession Diary is an app targeted towards high-school to college age users and allows for anonymous confessions. These confessions can be experiences dealing with teachers or classes. Maybe you want to write about how bad the school cafeteria is or advice for upcoming classes. However, the main purpose is for students to be able to talk about serious problems related to school or just problems that come with being in that age frame. While protecting their identity, users can get advice from other peers who are maybe experiencing the same thing. Confessions can range from various topics and its as simple as posting and awaiting comments from other users.
